Illusion Progress Bar:
=======================
Original idea by Nick Dunn

Author of the second branch: Daneel Reventelov 

Description:
---------------------
 The *illusion bar* is a particular effect that gives only a graphic movement on the completed part of a progress bar and creates the *illusion* of real progress even if the bar remains steady.
 
 This is a **Human Computer Interface** technique to calm the user during long operation to give the impression that computer is not frozen  and it makes something.

 The original author, **Nick Dunn**, had create a gradient that gives the illusion effect, and the actual author, **Daneel Reventelov** (me), extends the effect with other customizable effects, shapes and colors and ans helpful testing Gui to help the user to choose right effect for his project
  

> ### New Effects: 
>
 * Color bar (2 colors light and dark with gradient between each other) (customizable)
 * Multi Color bar (more couple of colors to have an iridescent gradient (customizable)
 * Rounded shape (customizable)
 * Shadows (customizable)
